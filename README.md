> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a meta-dataset of existing databases and is therefore _not_ indexed on [docs.metapsy.org/databases](https://docs.metapsy.org/databases).

The `data-total-response` dataset is part of the [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). This meta-dataset combines information from 8 databases included within the project, focusing on the calculated response rates within the intervention and control groups. 
These databases are:

- Psychotherapies for **Depression** ([`depression-psyctr`](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-depression-psyctr)).
- Psychotherapies for **Panic Disorder** ([`panic-psyctr`](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-panic-psyctr)).
- Psychotherapies for **Social Anxiety Disorder**.
- Psychotherapies for **Specific Phobias**.
- Psychotherapies for **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**.
- Psychological Treatments for **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder** ([`ptsd-psyctr`](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-ptsd-psyctr)).
- Psychotherapies for **Borderline Personality Disorder** ([`borderline-psyctr`](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-borderline-psyctr)).
- Psychological Treatments for **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder**.

The dataset includes psychotherapy vs. control ('psy vs ctr') comparisons. Response rates and relative risks are provided for outcomes at post-test. 

The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/). All included information has been independently extracted two researchers. Risk of bias ratings were conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool (Version 1 or Version 2, depending on the database from which studies were extracted).
